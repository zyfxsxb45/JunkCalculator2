## Technical Overview

### Architecture
- **Lexer**: Tokenizer supporting over 55 token types, including string interpolation (`f""`), raw strings with custom delimiters (`r"TAG()TAG"`), alternating single/double quotes, imaginary suffixes (`3i`), and variadic ellipsis (`...`).
- **Parser**: Recursive descent parser producing an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) with over 30 node types. Supports operator precedence, block statements, comma sequence evaluation, and destructuring.
- **Compiler**: AST-to-bytecode compiler utilizing the Visitor pattern. Handles lexical scoping, auto-local variable declaration, loop patching, and closure capture.
- **Virtual Machine**: Stack-based bytecode interpreter. Implements late-binding for function calls, exception handling with line-number unwinding, an interactive step-debugger, execution profiling, and dynamic operator dispatching.

### Language Semantics
- **Type System & Memory Management**: `std::variant`-backed dynamic typing supporting 17 internal types. 
  - *Value Types*: Scalars (double, BigInt, Complex) and Matrices (Real, Complex, String) use contiguous memory and pass-by-value semantics.
  - *Reference Types*: Containers (`List`, `Dict`, `Set`) and OOP `Instance`s use pass-by-reference semantics (backed by PIMPL architecture and `std::shared_ptr`).
- **Gradual Typing**: Optional runtime type contracts for function parameters and return values (e.g., `func(a: double, b: matrix) -> bool = ...`). Supports base types, containers, and class inheritance definitions.
- **Garbage Collection (GC)**: Mark-and-Sweep Garbage Collector (`GcHeap`) executing on top of the VM stack. Traces GC roots (Globals, Stack, Upvalues, and Contexts) to resolve cyclic references.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Single inheritance (`extends`), `super` dispatching, and operator overloading via dunder methods (e.g., `__add__`). Instances support destructuring assignment.
- **Control Flow**: `if/else`, `while`, `for`, `for-in`, `switch/case`, `break/continue/return`.
- **Error Handling**: `try/catch/throw` constructs and functional `pcall` with stack tracebacks.
- **Execution Control**: Robust `Ctrl+C` interrupt mechanism to safely halt infinite loops or heavy CAS computations without crashing the VM. Pressing `Ctrl+C` three times consecutively triggers an immediate hard exit.
- **Functions**: Closures, lambdas `(x) => expr`, default parameters, variadic arguments (`...args`), and `ref` parameter binding.
- **Generic Container API**: Array manipulation functions (`push`, `slice`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `sort`, `join`, `zip`, etc.) operate across four container types: `RealMatrix`, `ComplexMatrix`, `StringMatrix`, and `List`.
- **Set Algebra**: `Set` type with O(1) membership testing (`in`). Supports operators for union (`|`), intersection (`&`), difference (`-`), and Cartesian product (`*`). Includes powerset generation (`setPow`) and relation predicates.

### Mathematics & CAS Engine
- **Computer Algebra System (CAS)**: A symbolic mathematics engine operating on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG). Features simplification (`simplify`, `expand`, `contract`, `factor`, `trigsimp`), symbolic calculus (`diff`, `integ`, `limit`, `taylor`), and exact analytic root finding (`solveEq`).
- **Polynomial Algebra**: Uses Subresultant Pseudo-Remainder Sequences for polynomial GCD, and Finite Field $\mathbb{Z}_p$ mapping (Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm) for multivariate factorization. 
- **Integration Engine**: Implements subsets of the Risch algorithm, including Hermite reduction, the Rothstein-Trager algorithm, and Liouvillian differential field extensions.
- **Arbitrary-Precision**: Base-10^9 compressed `BigInt` layout. Implements high-base division, GCD/LCM, and modular exponentiation.
- **Exact Rationals & Promotion**: `Fraction` types recursively cross-reduce. Exact rational powers (e.g., `(1/2)^(1/2)`) that cannot be resolved numerically auto-promote into `SymExpr` CAS trees to prevent floating-point precision loss.
- **Linear Algebra**: `Matrix<T>` template supporting Gaussian-Jordan elimination, QR decomposition (Modified Gram-Schmidt), LU decomposition (Doolittle partial pivoting), and Eigenvalues (Hessenberg + Givens QR iteration).

### Native Modules & Standard Library
Native C++ extensions exposed to the execution context:
- `image`: OOP-based BMP generation, drawing primitives with SDF (Signed Distance Field) sub-pixel anti-aliasing, and ASCII font rendering.
- `prob`: OOP-based statistical distributions (PDF, CDF, Quantile via Newton iteration) and hypothesis tests.
- `json`: JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `socket`: Low-level TCP/IP networking stack (WinSock2/POSIX bindings).
- `bytes`: Memory buffering and low-level binary I/O operations.
- `window`: Native GUI window rendering engine. Supports Mouse-Look pointer capturing and independent IME toggling (Win32).
- `latex`: Bi-directional LaTeX engine. Serializes JC2 objects to LaTeX, and parses raw LaTeX formulas into executable closures.

JC2 standard libraries loaded via `import`:
- `collections`: Data structures including `Stack`, `Queue`, `Deque`, `PriorityQueue` (Heap), and Search Trees.
- `regex`: Object-Oriented NFA regex engine with capture groups, alternation, and quantifiers.
- `discrete`: Discrete mathematics toolkit covering combinatorics, binary relations, and graph traversal.
- `engine`: Game framework abstraction over the `window` module for render loops and event state management.
- `net`: OOP wrapper for TCP streams (`TcpSocket` and `TcpServer`).
- `http`: HTTP/1.1 client supporting URL parsing and GET/POST requests.
- `buffer`: Binary manipulation API with cursor support.

## What's New in v2.4.0.0

Version 2.4.0.0 introduces significant architectural improvements, including a NaN-Boxing memory model and a raw pointer evaluation stack, resulting in substantial performance gains. The language syntax has been expanded with Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS), native namespaces, block-scoped variables, and element-wise matrix operations.

### Core Architecture & Performance
- **NaN-Boxing Memory Model**: Replaced `std::variant` with a NaN-Boxing implementation for the dynamic `Value` type system, reducing memory footprint and improving dispatch speed. Introduced a dedicated boolean type (`ObjType::BOOL`).
- **Raw Pointer Stack**: Replaced the `std::vector`-based evaluation stack in the VM with a raw pointer array, eliminating dynamic reallocation overhead.
- **Compiler Optimizations**: Implemented constant folding and dead code elimination.
- **Lazy Allocation**: Built-in closures are now lazily allocated and cached, significantly reducing Garbage Collector pressure during startup.

### Language Features & Syntax
- **Complex Destructuring**: Destructuring assignments now support complex l-values, allowing direct assignment to array indices and object properties (e.g., `[a[1], b.prop] = [1, 2]`).
- **Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS)**: Functions can now be called using method syntax (e.g., `data.map(f)` is equivalent to `map(data, f)`), enhancing functional chaining with the pipe operator.
- **Namespaces**: Introduced the `namespace` keyword for modular encapsulation. Namespaces are compiled as IIFEs returning a dictionary, supporting upvalue-backed fields and `const` exports.
- **Block-Scoped Variables**: Added the `local` keyword to explicitly declare variables bound to the current block (`{}`, `if`, `for`), preventing function-scope pollution.
- **Multi-line Strings**: Added support for triple-quoted strings (`"""` or `'''`), fully compatible with `f` (interpolation) and `r` (raw) prefixes.
- **Lambda Enhancements**: Anonymous functions now support `ref` parameter binding and variadic arguments (`...`).
- **Callable Instances**: Added the `__call__` magic method, allowing class instances to be invoked like functions.

### Memory & Object Model
- **Value-Based Container Equality**: Refactored equality and hashing logic for containers (`List`, `Dict`, `Set`) to support deep, value-based comparisons.
- **O(1) Hash Caching**: Introduced a lazy hash cache for frozen containers, reducing the time complexity of using them as dictionary keys or set elements from O(N) to O(1).
- **Deep Cloning**: Added the `copy()` built-in function for deep cloning objects while perfectly preserving their frozen/unfrozen states.

### Math Engine & Matrix Operations
- **Element-wise Broadcasting**: Replaced implicit scalar broadcasting with a comprehensive suite of explicit element-wise operations (`addE`, `subE`, `mulE`, `divE`, `eqE`, `ltE`, `whereE`, etc.) supporting scalar-scalar, scalar-matrix, and matrix-matrix computations.
- **Strict IEEE 754 Comparisons**: Removed fuzzy floating-point comparisons in favor of strict IEEE 754 standards. Added the `isapprox` function for tolerance-based comparisons.
- **Forced Double-Precision Roots**: Added `sqrtD`, `cbrtD`, and `rootD` to bypass CAS symbolic promotion and directly compute numerical roots.
- **Bitwise Operations**: Redefined bitwise NOT `~x` strictly as `-x-1` and removed implicit `BaseNum` conversions during bitwise operations.

### Type System & Tooling
- **Duck Typing Contracts**: Enhanced runtime type assertions with behavioral contracts (`iterable`, `callable`, `indexable`, `hashable`) and new type annotations (`str`, `whole`, `exact`).
- **Dynamic Compilation**: Added `compileFile()` and `compileCode()` to dynamically compile external scripts or strings into bytecode closures at runtime.
- **System Stability**: Implemented a safe `Ctrl+C` thread interrupt mechanism. Embedded application icon and version metadata for Windows executables.
- **VS Code Extension**: Upgraded the language server with hover providers, document symbol outlines, and code snippets.

## Building

Requires a C++20 compliant compiler and CMake 3.15+.

    cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build --config Release

*Note: On MSVC, the CMake script uses `/MT` static linkage and Link Time Code Generation (`/GL`, `/LTCG`).*

---

## Command-Line Interface

    JunkCalculator2                    # Interactive REPL session
    JunkCalculator2 script.jc2         # Execute a script
    JunkCalculator2 --run script.jc2   # Execute a script (explicit flag)
    JunkCalculator2 script.jc2 -d      # Execute and print bytecode disassembly
    JunkCalculator2 script.jc2 --debug # Execute with interactive step-debugger
    JunkCalculator2 script.jc2 --profile # Execute and print performance report

*Script Path Context: The `run` and `import` instructions push the executing script's directory onto a paths stack, resolving relative I/O based on the current file's location rather than the terminal's working directory.*
